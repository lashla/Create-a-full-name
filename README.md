# Create-a-full-name
In the code template below, you can see a program that creates a full name from the first and last names of several people. Wouldn't it be much easier if we had a function that could do the same?

Your task is to create a function createFullName that takes firstName as the first argument and lastName as the second argument and returns the full name.

## Sample Input 1:

John
Lennon
## Sample Output 1:
